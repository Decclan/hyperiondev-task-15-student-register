- Fetches user parameters - total number of students, student I.D length
- Confirms with user that the file will be overwritten if it already exists (w+)
- Option to view list of added I.D's
- If the I.D number is less than the maximum I.D length, zero characters will be added before the number.
- Includes input validation
